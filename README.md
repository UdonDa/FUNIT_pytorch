+ `bash preprosess.sh`
+ `pythona main.py --loss_type ls --n_critic 1`
+ `pythona main.py --loss_type bce --n_critic 1`, I fail to learn the models.
+ `pythona main.py --loss_type hinge --n_critic 5`
+ `pythona main.py --loss_type wgangp --n_critic 5`

# Dataset
I use UECFOOD256(http://foodcam.mobi/dataset256.html), which official paper also use this dataset as Foods.
If you want to use thid dataset, please cite this paper and check rules.
